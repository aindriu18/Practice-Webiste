                        Here are my most recent results in the Software Development Apprenticeship Programme.
                        So far, we have been assessed on pseudocode, object orientated programming, the principles of ICT systems and data security
                        and web fundamentals. The grading system encompasses either a pass, merit or distinction. The course itself revolves hugely
                        around continuous assessment and examinations. Be sure to check back regularly for more exam results!

                        Before my escapades into the world of technology, I had a previous life of study and education. After completing my Leaving Cert
                        in 2011, I entered University College Dublin at 17 where I studied history, politics and international relations for the
                        next 3 years. I had a particular interest in revolutionary and paramilitary groups, both left and right on the political axis. I
                        also enjoyed studying the history of the USSR and the Eastern bloc along with the history and politics of the Middle East and
                        North Africa Region. In 2014, I graduated with a BA joint major in History Politics and International Relations.

                        After I graduated in 2014, I decided I would like to continue my studies and complete a masters. In the same year, I began an MA in
                        Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict in University College Dublin. This course enabled me to study revolutionary groups, paramilitary organisations 
                        and conflict regions in more detail. As part of my course work, I had to write a 15,000 word dissertation. My piece focused
                        primarily on the IRA and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. As you can see from my results table, I received an A- for my
                        efforts. After a short period of time, my dissertation was picked up by <a href="https://www.bookhubpublishing.com/"> Book Hub Publishing</a> based
                        in Co. Galway. The picture above is the cover for my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Millennials-Insight-Republicanism-Northern-Troubles-ebook/dp/B06XRF7J49/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=aindriu+inglis&qid=1561830276&s=gateway&sr=8-1">eBook</a>
