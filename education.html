            Here are my most recent results in the Software Development Apprenticeship Programme.
            So far, we have been assessed on pseudocode, object orientated programming, the principles of ICT systems and data security
            and web fundamentals. The grading system encompasses either a pass, merit or distinction. The course itself revolves hugely
            around continuous assessment and examinations. Be sure to check back regularly for more exam results!

            Before my escapades into the world of technology, I had a previous life of study and education. After completing my Leaving Cert
            in 2011, I entered University College Dublin at 17 where I studied history, politics and international relations for the
            next 3 years. I had a particular interest in revolutionary and paramilitary groups, both left and right on the political axis. I
            also enjoyed studying the history of the USSR and the Eastern bloc along with the history and politics of the Middle East and
            North Africa Region. In 2014, I graduated with a BA joint major in History Politics and International Relations. In the same year
            and institution, I enrolled in a Masters programme where I eventually graduated in 2016.

            My MA in political science specialised in Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict. This course enabled me to study revolutionary groups, paramilitary organisations 
            and conflict regions in more detail. As part of my course work, I had to write a 15,000 word dissertation. My piece focused
            primarily on the IRA and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. As you can see from my results table, I received an A- for my
            efforts. After a short period of time, my dissertation was picked up by <a href="https://www.bookhubpublishing.com/"> Book Hub Publishing</a> based
            in Co. Galway. The picture above is the cover for my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Millennials-Insight-Republicanism-Northern-Troubles-ebook/dp/B06XRF7J49/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=aindriu+inglis&qid=1561830276&s=gateway&sr=8-1" target="_blank" >eBook</a> 
            which is available to buy on Amazon.
