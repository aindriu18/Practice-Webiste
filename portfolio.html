    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>

            This was the first test I had during the programme. Learning a new language with C# was difficult enough
            never mind trying to
            get to grips with Pseudocode. After several attempts and a crash course on Pseudocode lingo, I eventually
            got the hang of it
            and understood why this is such an important part in the planning stage of writing clear and concise code.
            Togehter with one of my
            classmates, we produced the Pseudocode you can see above.

    <h3>Basic Object Oriented Programming with C#</h3>

        <p class="c-sharp-para">
            The C# examination was one of hardest exams I've done in all my years of education. Despite being well
            prepared, it was unlike any other
            exam I've ever sat. Throughout the module, we became accustomed with classes, methods and functions. We
            worked through for loops, arrays
            and if statements. The funny thing is, we've only scratched the surface of this hugely powerful language. In
            semester 2, we delve further
            into the world of C# and Object Oriented Programming. The photos above are from a practice test I did for
            our exam earlier in the year.

    <h3>Principles of ICT Systems and Data Security</h3>
    <div class="data-slide">
        <!-- Used an iframe as the video file was too large for the website. Let youtube do that work instead-->
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIq0J7Sr7eo" frameborder="0"

        <p class="data">
            Whilst not a programming module per se, I found this module hugely beneficial on many fronts. Discussing
            areas surrounding
            malware, encryption and data security is not only beneficial for work place environments, but also in every
            day aspects of our lives.
            As a class, we were afforded the opportunity to work together and make presentations on various topics. My
            classmate Bryan Donnelly and
            I presented on encryption and hash functions. From the video you can see above, we demonstrated the process
            of a dictionary attack on
            over 14 million passwords. Below you can also see a copy of the presentation we made in front of our tutor
            and classmates.

    <h3>Database Programming - SQL</h3>
    <div class="sql-slide">
        <!--HTML framed in a way that enables the slick carousel library to function-->
        <div class="sql">
            <div><img src="./images/test_1.PNG" alt="SQL Test No1"></div>
            <div><img src="./images/test_2.PNG" alt="SQL Test No10"></div>

        </div>

        <p>
            With the SQL database module, we learned how to navigate throguh a relatively small database using commands
            such as "SELECT", "WHERE,
            "IN", "FROM" and "TO". We also became accustomed with inner joins and nested selects too. I really enjoyed
            this module and I look forward
            to the semester 2 database module where we go a little bit more in depth in relation to how databases are
            actally created. The photos above
            are snippet coppies of the SQL database exam we had earlier this year.

    <h3>Web Worker</h3>

    <div class="webWorker">
        <!--This displays the numbers counter as the web worker operates-->
        <h4>Count Numbers: <output id="result"></output></h4>

        <p>
            Above is a demonstration of a simple web worker as required for the web assignment submission. Normally web
            workers aren’t used for such simple
            scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks.
        </p>

        <!--Creates the start and stop button for the web worker.-->
        <button class="webButton" onclick="startWorker()">Start Worker</button>
        <button class="webButton" onclick="stopWorker()">Stop Worker</button>
