    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>

            This was the first test I had during the programme. Learning a new language with C# was difficult enough never mind trying to
            get to grips with Pseudocode. After several attempts and a crash course on Pseudocode lingo, I eventually got the hang of it
            and understood why this is such an important part in the planning stage of writing clear and concise code. Togehter with one of my 
            classmates, we produced the Pseudocode you can see above.

    <h3>Basic Object Oriented Programming with C#</h3>

            The C# examination was one of hardest exams I've done in all my years of education. Despite being well prepared, it was unlike any other
            exam I've ever sat. Throughout the module, we became accustomed with classes, methods and functions. We worked through for loops, arrays
            and if statements. The funny thing is, we've only scratched the surface of this hugely powerful language. In semester 2, we delve further
            into the world of C# and Object Oriented Programming. The photos above are from a practice test I did for our exam earlier in the year.

    <h3>Principles of ICT Systems and Data Security</h3>

        <p>
            Whilst not a programming module per se, I found this module hugely beneficial on many fronts. Discussing areas surrounding
            malware, encryption and data security is not only beneficial for work place environments, but also in every day aspects of our lives.
            As a class, we were afforded the opportunity to work together and make presentations on various topics. My classmate Bryan Donnelly and
            I presented on encryption and hash functions. From the video you can see above, we demonstrated the process of a dictionary attack on
            over 14 million passwords. Below you can also see a copy of the presentation we made in front of our tutor and classmates.

    <h3>Database Programming - SQL</h3>

        </div>

        <p>
            With the SQL database module, we learned how to navigate throguh a relatively small database using commands such as "SELECT", "WHERE,
            "IN", "FROM" and "TO". We also became accustomed with inner joins and nested selects too. I really enjoyed this module and I look forward
            to the semester 2 database module where we go a little bit more in depth in relation to how databases are actally created. The photos above
            are snippet coppies of the SQL database exam we had earlier this year.
