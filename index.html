        <p>
            Join me as I try and navigate through the world of programming, software development and everything in between. As a complete 
            novice with no previous experience within the tech sector, I hope to provide an insight into a booming industry and highlight how I 
            will eventually make your job redundant through automation! If you would like to get in contact, you can do so by clicking on any 
            of the social media links at the bottom of the page or alternitively, you can visit my Contact page for further information.

        <h2>The Course</h2>
        <p>
            Tech companies recruit an apprentice (like me) for a 2 year programme with the assistance of <a href="http://fit.ie">FIT</a>. The first 6 months require apprentices to attend full time, off
            the job training. This takes place in the <a href="http://www.rstc.ie">Regional Skills and Training Centre</a> in Dundalk, Co. Louth where we
            are tutored by Dean Harrison of <a href="http://oiliuna.ie">Oiliuna</a> . The
            next 7 - 18 months includes working at my company, <a href="http://www.intactsoftware.com">Intact,</a> for 3 days a week and then 2 days in
            the RSTC. Months 19 - 24 are broken up into 4 day periods at our companies and 1 day in the RSTC. After 2 years, we then work full time as
            qualified (hopefully) software developers.

        <h2>My Company</h2>
        <p>
            I was very fortunate that <a href="https://www.intactsoftware.com">Intact</a> were willing to take a chance with me and employ me 
            as their apprentice. They requested someone who was a complete beginner but had an interest in the world of technology and a proven track
            record of self taught learning and education. The company HQ is based in my hometown of Dundalk, Co. Louth and it has offices all across 
            Ireland and the UK. They have over 26 years experience in the field of enterprise resource planning and they supply a wide array of small and
            medium businesses with their software. In laymans terms, Intact develops software that organisations and companies use to manage day-to-day business 
            activities, such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations.
